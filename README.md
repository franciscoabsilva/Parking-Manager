# Parking Manager
Project for Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

## Introduction
This project is a car park management system. The system allows the definition of parking lots and the recording of vehicle entries and exits, as well as consultation and billing.

Interaction with the program must occur through a set of lines composed of a letter (command) and a number of arguments depending on the command to be executed. You can assume that all input provided will respect the indicated types, for example where a decimal integer value is expected, a letter will never be introduced. Possible commands are listed in the following table and indicate the operations to be performed.

## Action Commands
- **q**: ends the program  
- **p**: Create a car park with the invoicing system or list existing car parks  
- **e**: Registers the entry of a vehicle  
- **s**: Registers the departure of a vehicle  
- **v**: Lists the entries and departures of a vehicle  
- **f**: Shows billing for a car park  
- **r**: Removes a car park from the system
